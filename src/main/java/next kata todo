SQL Basics: Simple JOIN with COUNT


For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table, and join to the toys table so that you can return the COUNT of the toys

people table schema
id
name
toys table schema
id
name
people_id
You should return all people fields as well as the toy count as "toy_count".

NOTE: You're solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.



/////

-- Create your SELECT statement here


results = run_sql

describe :items do
   it "should return 2 items" do
    expect(results.count).to eq 2
   end
   
   it "should return names" do
     results.each do |result|
       expect(result[:name]).to eq find_record(:people, result[:id]).name
     end
   end
   
   it "should return toy count" do
    results.each do |result|
      toys = find_records_by_people_id(:toys, result[:id])
      expect(result[:toy_count]).to eq toys.count
    end
   end
end
